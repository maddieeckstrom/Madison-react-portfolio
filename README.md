# Madison-react-portfoio

## Description

This application is my all-inclusive portfolio. It provies a bio of myself, some previous web development work that I've accomplished, a downloadable resume in PDF format, and a contact form for those wishing to email me. I will be using it not only to connect with professionals in the industry, but to apply to jobs as well.

## Getting Started

This program has been deployed to Netlify and thus does not need any installations to run.
